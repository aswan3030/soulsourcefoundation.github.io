<p>Soul Source board member Aaron Swanton and his partner Cauleen Smith, had the pleasure of visiting Kenya from December 25, 2015 to January 16, 2016 and spent significant time in  the Western section of the country and on Rusinga Island.  They had an amazing journey and were able to meet with many of the people and groups that we support. The experience included meeting  with many of the Womenâ€™s Empowerment Groups, two nursery schools, girls groups, youth groups and OMP scholarship students and parents as well as the staff of Kamasengre Mixed Secondary School.Catch up on some highlights of the trip</p>
